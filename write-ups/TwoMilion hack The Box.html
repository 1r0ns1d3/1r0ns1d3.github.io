               			<p>Due to a rather slow connection or pings being blocked the scan does not complete and i have to adjust the command.
                			nmap -A -vv -p- 10.129.203.35 -Pn</p>
               			<p>this command on its own takes over 3 hours to complete. so the -T5 argument is given to speed up the process, knowing that detection is not a relevant issue on hack the box.
                  			nmap -A -vv -p- 10.129.203.35 -Pn -T5</p>
               			<p>The command gave the following output</p>
               			<p>Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked &#39;up&#39; and scan times may be slower.

                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726115348.png"></p>
                  			<p>now the webpage should load correctly</p>
                  			<p>on the login page a register button was found allowing me to go to /invite</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726120153.png"></p>
                  			<p>this page contained a javascript with the function makeInviteCode this function was called from the console to generate the following data:</p> 
                  			<p>Va beqre gb trarengr gur vaivgr pbqr, znxr n CBFG erdhrfg gb /ncv/i1/vaivgr/trarengr</p>
                  			<p>this message was ROT13 encoded after decoding this message in cyberchef the cleartext message was:</p>
                  			<p>In order to generate the invite code, make a POST request to /api/v1/invite/generate</p>
                  			<p>to do this I used Curl with the following command:</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726120350.png"></p>
                  			<p>as seen in the image it returned another code:</p>
                  			<p>QU9HRlgtODlHMVctUURKSDctSUlQODM=</p>
                  			<p>This looks base64 encoded, so we will use cyberchef again to decode this message, the cleartext code was:</p>
                  			<p>AOGFX-89G1W-QDJH7-IIP83</p>
                  			<p>this looks like it could be an invite code so let&#39;s try using it</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726120549.png"></p>
                  			<p>it works now we can register an account and continue our enumeration</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726120727.png"></p>
                  			<p>we are redirected to our homepage and from here we start enumerating again, and on the access page we find two buttons that make an API call</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726120931.png"></p>
                  			<p>using burpsuite and intercepting the request we adjust the request to probe the API</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726121303.png"></p>
                  			<p>and as we can see there are a couple of API calls available I will now try what can be achieved using the API calls</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726121616.png"></p>
                  			<p>we can see that we can update settings however we need to get the correct message content type</p>
                  			<p>as we have seen that the API uses JSON format this will be our first attempt</p>
                  			<p>&quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;</p>
                  			<p>after tinkering a lot with the message and the formatting i get an update stating that my account is now admin</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726122211.png"><p/>
                  			<p>going back to the API call we could generate a vpn connection for admin, now that we have an admin account we can try generating this file, after some more tinkering the file is generated and send to burp </p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726122505.png"></p>
                  			<p>unfortunately the openvpn file does not give me a connection, however the generation is a local process, so perhaps we could inject some commands</p>
                  			<p>it appears that the username parameter is vulnerable to a command injection attack</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726122755.png"></p>
                  			<p>after the first few attempts to get a reverse shell i get no response so I will try encoding the payloads as there may be some filtering mechanism</p>
                  			<p>after base 64 encoding and decoding in the payload i get a shell</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726123310.png"></p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726123254.png"></p>
                  			<p>after some basic enumeration there appears to be a user named &quot;admin&quot;</p>
                  			<p>in the PWD after getting a shell there appears to be a hidden file that contains credentials for a user also named admin</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726123641.png"></p>
                  			<p>they should be DB passwords but let&#39;s see if password is being reused</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726123747.png"></p>
                  			<p>the password is indeed being reused now we have control of the user in an attempt to get a more stable shell i will check to see if this user is allowed a SSH connection</p>
                  			<p>and that is indeed allowed this connection is way more stable and now I can release the old connection</p>
                  			<p>Now we start enumerating for root first checking sudo -l, however this user is not allowed to use sudo.</p>
                  			<p>after further enumeration in the /var/mail we find that admin has got mail</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726124607.png"></p>
                  			<p>this kernel might be exploitable</p>
                  			<p><img src="static/img/Pasted%20image%2020240726124631.png"></p>
                  			<p>it would appear that this kernel is vulnerable to the DirtyPipe exploit so I will try to use this exploit to gain a root shell</p>
                  			<p>afer using the exploit from <a href="https://github.com/xkaneiki/CVE-2023-0386">https://github.com/xkaneiki/CVE-2023-0386</a> this github we get a root shell</p>
